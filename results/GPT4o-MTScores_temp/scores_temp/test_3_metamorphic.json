The overall movements are subtle, with the time-lapse indicating minor adjustments and relocations of the starfish. Variations are more quantitative, displaying only small, individual motions without significant dynamic activity.\n\"Score\":{2}",
    "test_5": "Brief Reasoning Statement: The changes in the frames show a significant amount of dynamic movement with the fish swimming around actively. The movement of the fish creates continuous and rapid variation in the scene, giving a vivid visual effect. This variation includes both quantitative changes (positions and swimming patterns of the fish) and qualitative changes (overall scene dynamics).\n\"Score\":{4}"
