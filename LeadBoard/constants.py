    Welcome to the leaderboard of the ChronoMagic-Bench! 
     
    üèÜChronoMagic-Bench represents the inaugural benchmark dedicated to assessing T2V models' capabilities in generating time-lapse videos that demonstrate significant metamorphic amplitude and temporal coherence. The benchmark probes T2V models for their physics, biology, and chemistry capabilities, in a free-form text control.

    ## Submit Example
    For example, if you want to upload Video-ChatGPT's result in the leaderboard, you need to:
    1. Fill in 'MagicTime' in 'Model Name' if it is your first time to submit your result (You can leave 'Revision Model Name' blank).
    2. Fill in 'MagicTime' in 'Revision Model Name' if you want to update your result (You can leave 'Model Name' blank).
    3. Select ‚ÄòBackbone Type‚Äô (DiT or U-Net).
    4. Fill in 'https://github.com/x/x' in 'Model Link'.
    5. Upload `ChronoMagic-Bench-Input.json`.
    6. Click the 'Submit Eval' button.
